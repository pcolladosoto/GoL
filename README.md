# A Game of Life implementation
This repository contains an implementation of the [Game of Life](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Conway%27s_Game_of_Life) devised by John Horton Conway.

We have chosen to leverage the capabilities offered by the [Löve2D](https://love2d.org) game engine as it let's us deal with the *low-level* side of things. Games for *Löve2D* are implemented as [`lua`](http://www.lua.org) scripts which means we can just condense it all in a simple source file.

## Running the game
You'll need to install [Löve2D](https://love2d.org) as seen on its site and then run the folder containing the game which is implemented in the `main.lua` script. We'll add a more in depth guide with time...
